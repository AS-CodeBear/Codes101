especially how inputs are to be given and how the output needs to be printed]
Abhishek is a first-year student. He has always topped in his class and wants to do the same here.
He came to know that his performance in IIT Kanpur is judged based on his Cumulative Performance Index (CPI). 
Abhishek is too lazy to calculate his CPI and would like you to calculate his CPI given his expected grades in various subjects.

CPI Calculation
CPI is calculated as follows. Each letter grade (A, B, C, D, E, F) corresponds to some points out of 10.
A - 10/10
B - 8/10
C - 6/10
D - 4/10
E - 2/10
F - 0/10

Also, each course has some associated credits which is used to calculate the total points awarded in that course. 
So, if a course Course1 has 14 credits and a student scores ‘B’ grade in that course, then the student will be awarded 
14 * 8 = 112 points for that course. 

CPI = (Sum of total points in all courses) / (Sum of credits of all courses)

For example, if a student takes 3 courses Course1, Course2, Course3 of 4, 3, 5 credits respectively, and scores grades B, C, A,
Course1 4 B
Course2 3 C
Course3 5 A

Then his CPI is calculated as follows:
(4 * 8 + 3 * 6 + 5 * 10) / (4 + 3 + 5)

Input
Input consists of three lines. Each line consists of course specification in the following format
  
Each course name consists of exactly 3 characters and grade is represented in Capital letters.

Constraints: 1 <= Credits <=100
	         Grade ? {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’, ‘F’}


Output
Output the calculated cpi as a floating point number (upto 2 decimal places).

Example
Input 
ESC 14 A
MTH 11 B
PHY 11 D
Output  
7.56

Hint: Note that the course code consisting of three letters is not needed in the calculation of CPI so 
the part of your code that reads the inputs needs to ignore these three letters somehow.*/
