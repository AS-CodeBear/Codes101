/*You were taught series in MTH101  along with epsilon-delta stories. They were summation of terms of a sequence.
As you have progressed to a new semester, Prutor wants you to sum up series. The time has come to put your math 
skills at rest 'for a while'. Use your newly acquired C skills. No marks for solving by computing overall
formula, problem is much simpler with advanced recent knowledge!
Hint : Make your program proceed by creating and adding each number in the order it is written below.

Input : A positive integer n
Output : Print the sum of the series : 
1 + (2+2) + (3+3+3) + ..... + (n + n + n ....+n) 

Example
Input
2

Output
5

Input Constraints:
1≤ n ≤100
