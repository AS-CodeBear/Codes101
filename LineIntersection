/*Prof. X is an expert in geometrical maths. He tests you on this at the basic level. 
Pass all of his test cases to show your expertise.
You are given 2 lines of the form y=mx+c. Tell whether they intersect or not. 
Print “INTERSECT” if they intersect at one point, “SAME” if they coincide, “PARALLEL” if they don’t intersect.

INPUT:
The first line contains 2 space-separated floating-point numbers, m1 and c1.
The second line contains 2 space-separated floating-point numbers, m2 and c2.

OUTPUT:
Print a single line with “SAME”, “INTERSECT” or “PARALLEL” (without quotes).

CONSTRAINTS:
−1000≤m1,m2,c1,c2≤1000

EXAMPLE:
INPUT:
10.0 1.2
10.0 3.2
OUTPUT:
PARALLEL
