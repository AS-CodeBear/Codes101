/*You are given the mid-sem and the end-sem scores of the students of a course. 
You are needed to find the median of the final weighted scores (scaled to 100) for the course. 
Mid-sem has 40% weightage and end-sem marks contribute for rest 60% of the course weightage. 
Mid-sem was held out of a total of 50 marks and End-sem was held out of a total 100  marks. 
Interestingly there were only three students (A, B & C) registered for the course.

There would be two identical lines of input. Both will have three floating numbers denoting 
the marks of the students A, B and C in same order. First line for mid-sem marks and second line for end-sem marks.
For output, the median score should be rounded up to second decimal place.

Example - 
Input :
20.0 40.0 30.0
60.0 50.0 70.0

Output :
Median weighted score = 62.00

Explanation :
For this example the final weighted and scaled marks for the three students would be as below :
A = 20*40/50 + 60*60/100 = 52.00
B = 40*40/50 + 50*60/100 = 62.00
