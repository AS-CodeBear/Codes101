/*Naman loves maths and asks Pragya to challenge him by giving him different tasks to perform.
After completing his task, he bugs her to check his answers. Pragya is very busy and wants
your help to automate the task of checking Naman’s answers. Help Pragya by designing a simple 
calculator-like application which takes a code corresponding to an operation, and then prompts the user 
to enter the appropriate number of arguments. Finally, it outputs the result.

Codes correspond to the following operations : 

1 : Takes two floating-point numbers and prints average of the two.
2 : Takes two floating-point numbers and prints absolute difference of the two.
3 : Takes a floating-point number and prints the result obtained by incrementing it by 1.
4 : Takes a floating-point number and prints its square.
Else print “Operation not supported!”

Note: Do not use any math.h library functions

INPUT:
Input consists of 2 lines.
First line consists of an integer corresponding to an operation code, opcode.
Second line consists of an appropriate number of floating-point numbers (ni) for that operation.

OUTPUT:
A single line containing the result or the error message (in case of invalid operation code).
Note: Round all results to 3 decimal places.

CONSTRAINTS:
−1000.0≤ni≤1000.0
0≤opcode≤100

EXAMPLE:
INPUT:
1
5.1 2.6
OUTPUT: 
3.850

INPUT:
3
4.5
OUTPUT:
5.500
