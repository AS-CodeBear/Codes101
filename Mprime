/*In this problem we define a special type of numbers called m-primes.
A number n is called m prime if it has exactly m distinct non trivial factors (i.e. factors excluding 1 and itself). 

For example, 10 is 2-prime since it has exactly two factors i.e 2 and 5. Similarly, 9 is 1-prime since it has only one factor i.e. 3.

Your task is to take m and n as input and check whether n is m-prime or not. If n is m-prime print YES otherwise print NO.

Example 1:
Input:
2 10

Output:
YES

Example 2:
Input:
2 9

Output:
NO

Note: Using arrays is neither required nor recommended.
