/*Harry and Ron are looking to meet Hagrid’s friend Aragog (his pet spider). Hagrid advised them 
that spiders are curious and intelligent creatures and they can follow them to achieve what they want.

They start following the spider’s trail in The Forbidden Forest, they notice that the trail sometimes split
into multiple trails and at this point they are not sure to follow which one as they all go in different directions. 
They recall something Hagrid told them about spiders.

If the trail of spiders splits into a number x, if the number x is divisible by 2 then you follow 
the leftmost trail, else if the number x is divisible by 3 then you follow the rightmost trail, else
you follow the original trail (go straight).

INPUT:
First line contains the number N of splits found while following the trail,
Second line contains N space-separated integers each denoting the number x of one of the splits.

OUTPUT:
N space-separated characters (either L, S or R) denoting the left, straight or right respectively.

EXAMPLE:

INPUT:
5
22 15 7 11 8

OUTPUT:
L R S S L

Explanation:
22 - divisible by 2, hence L (left).
15 - divisible by 3, hence R (right).
7 - not divisible by 2 or 3, hence S (straight).
11 - not divisible by 2 or 3, hence S (straight).
8 - divisible by 2, hence L (left).

Note: Few marks will be reserved for good programming practices.
