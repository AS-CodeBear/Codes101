/*This is your first day at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, you are taken to a dining room 
where each member of the school sits to eat and, here, you will be assigned one of the four houses 
(Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) by the Sorting Hat.
The Sorting Hat goes through your mind and picks the house based on the numbers that are going
through your mind, it picks the 2 numbers you are thinking of the most and does the following:

- If the 2 numbers are even and second divides the first one - Gryffindor
- If the 2 numbers are odd and second divides the first one - Slytherin
- If one number is even, other one is odd and second divides the first one - Ravenclaw
- Otherwise - Hufflepuff

You will be given a list of pairs (a pair will have 2 space-separated numbers) and you will have
to assign him/her the correct house.

INPUT:
The first line contains an integer N - denoting the number of pairs in the list.
The next N lines have 2 space-separated integers each denoting a single pair (in each line).

OUTPUT:
Each line should contain a single house name (out of the 4) denoting the house
assigned to the pair corresponding to that line.

EXAMPLE:

INPUT:
5
6 2
3 1
9 2
25 5
18 9

OUTPUT:
Gryffindor
Slytherin
Hufflepuff
Slytherin
Ravenclaw

Explanation:
Simply follow the rules mentioned in the question for each test case and you'll get the result.

Note: Few marks will be reserved for good programming practices.
