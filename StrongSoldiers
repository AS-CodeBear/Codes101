/*Winter has come and the king of Numberland has to fight the real war. This war is against the mad king of Numberburg. 
You are the chief army commander and you have to recruit the soldiers. A strong soldier is one whose Identity number is a strong number. You "accept" only the strong soldiers in the army.
We define strong number as a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. 
For example 0, 1, 153 (13+53+33=153) are strong numbers.

Guideline: Make sure that you code using FUNCTIONS to obtain maximum marks. YOU WILL LOSE MARKS IF THIS GUIDELINE IS NOT FOLLOWED.

INPUT:
A single line consisting of a single non-negative integer n.

OUTPUT:
A single line containing “Accept” if the soldier is selected, otherwise “Reject”.

CONSTRAINTS:
0≤n≤104

EXAMPLE:
Input:
153
Output: Accept   */
